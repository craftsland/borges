======

**borges** collects and stores Git repositories.

> I have always imagined that Paradise will be a kind of library.

Borges is a set of tools for collection and storage of Git repositories at large scale.
It is a distributed system, similar to a search engine, that uses a custom
repository storage [file format](https://blog.sourced.tech/post/siva/) and is optimized
for saving storage space and keeping repositories up-to-date.
